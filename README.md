CS253
=====

    Code for the blog project in Steve Huffman's Udacity CS253.  Planning to rework into
a personal website/resume, add asciichan for fun (two minutes of work, really), add the 
wiki final once I do it, and then refactor the whole darn thing as much as possible.
    Coursework mainly consisted of work within the main python file, Steve provided the 
HTML and CSS.  Plan to rework aesthetics at a later date as further Twitter Bootstrap 
practice
